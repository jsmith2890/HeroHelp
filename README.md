HeroHelp is the modern-day Bat Signal. More specifically, it's a two-sided real-time coordinated mobile app system for incident management. Citizens can call for help and Heroes can respond to dispatches and resolve incidents.

This project was created by four students at Fullstack Academy in Chicago. We had two weeks to put together a Capstone project -- a prototype application incorporating web technologies learned during the prior 10 weeks of the program as well as new technologies we were interested in exploring. We chose to explore integrating websockets with Google Maps and React Native to create a real-time incident management system.

An explanation of the top-level projects:
* **admin** : contains the admin interface
* **client** : contains the Citizen & Hero React Native apps
* **server** : contains the backend-server
* **simulator**	: contains the simulator. Essentially a node client that simulates the Citizen and Hero clients for helping to test the React Native apps independently
